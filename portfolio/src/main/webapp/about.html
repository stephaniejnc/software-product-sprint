      <p>Hi, I'm Stephanie - currently an incoming third year student at the University of British Columbia studying
          computer science, recently transferring from electrical engineering! Computer science is so versatile and can be 
          used to improve the world in so many different ways. Specifically, I have a passion for innovative technology within the medical field, and I'm currently working on implementing an 
          EEG-controlled Google Home Android application as a member of UBC's Biomedical Engineering Student Team (BEST) under the Multifaced Innovation in Neurotechnology Team (MINT)!
          <br><br>
          Apart from spending hours on end debugging labs, cramming for exams, and being confined to the rainy campus, I enjoy hiking and skiing across the Rocky Mountains, fencing epee and sabre, 
          as well as playing piano/flute/tuba!
          <br>
          Some of the projects I've worked on:
          <ul>
            <li>COVID-19 Symptoms Tracker: Co-created a self-reporting symptoms tracker for both personal and professional records. 
                Implemented Google Calendar API and event request handling with HTML, CSS, JavaScript,and Python.</li>
            <li>moodychat: Co-created a messenger app that colourfully indicates the tone of a message using Google’s Natural Language Processing 
                API to help Asperger’s patients have better conversations with Node.js/Express.js withsocket.io to create a chatbot messenger, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>        
            <li>Simple RISC Machine: implemented a simple data-path using digital logic designs in Verilog, designed a Finite State Machine controller to automate 
                the process of a small set of assembly instructions.</li>
          </ul>
          Feel free to drop me a message anytime! :) </p>
