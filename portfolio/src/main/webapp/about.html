      <p>Hi, I'm Stephanie - currently an incoming third year student at the University of British Columbia studying
          computer science, recently transferring from electrical engineering! Computer science is so versatile and can be 
          used to improve the world in so many different ways. Specifically, I have a passion for innovative technology within the medical field, and I'm currently working on implementing an 
          EEG-controlled Google Home Android application as a member of UBC's Biomedical Engineering Student Team (BEST) under the Multifaced Innovation in Neurotechnology Team (MINT)!
          <br><br>
          Apart from spending hours on end debugging labs, cramming for exams, and being confined to the rainy campus, I enjoy hiking and skiing across the Rocky Mountains, fencing epee and sabre, 
          as well as playing piano/flute/tuba!
          Feel free to drop me a message anytime! :) </p>
